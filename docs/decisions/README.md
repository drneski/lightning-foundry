# Decisions

Choices that are expensive to revisit, written down when they are made, while the reasoning is
still in someone's head. A decision record is not a design document; half a page is usually
right.

## Format

One file per decision, numbered in order: `NNNN-short-title.md`.

- **Status** — proposed, accepted, or superseded by a later record, which links back.
- **Decision** — what was decided, in a sentence or two.
- **Alternatives** — what else was on the table.
- **Why** — the reasoning that won.
- **Consequences** — what it makes easier, harder or impossible.

Records are not edited after acceptance, except to mark them superseded. Changing a decision
means writing a new record.

## Records
