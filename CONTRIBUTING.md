# Contributing

Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first — it holds the rules code is judged against. This document
covers the practical parts: getting set up, what to run, and what a reviewable change looks
like.

## Right now: not accepting external contributions

The license is provisional pending team review. Accepting outside contributions before it
settles would make it unchangeable, because relicensing needs the permission of everyone who
has contributed.

Issues, questions and design discussion are welcome in the meantime, and are the most useful
thing you can offer today. This section comes down when the license does.

## Setup

Nothing to install. There is no build, no package manager, and no dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drneski/lightning-foundry.git
cd lightning-foundry
node tests/contract.test.mjs
```

Node 22 or newer. That is the whole toolchain.

**There is no manifest on purpose.** The implementation language is undecided — see the open
decisions in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — and adding a `package.json`
would settle it silently.

## What to run

Run the tests covering what you touched, and say in the PR what you ran and what happened.
Report failures with their output. Never claim a suite passed that you did not run.

Deterministic tests only. Anything involving time, randomness or network conditions must be
injectable, so a check measures your change rather than the machine it ran on.

## What a change looks like

Small. One idea per pull request. A change that needs three paragraphs to explain what it is
doing probably wants to be three changes.

The description should say **what you verified**, not only what you wrote. "Added X" tells a
reviewer nothing about whether it works.

Every commit carries a `Co-Authored-By` trailer naming the model that helped write it — this
project requires AI assistance rather than merely permitting it. See
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md#attribution).

## Changes that need more review

Some areas get a second pair of eyes regardless of size:

- **Security policy, limits and permissions** — anything constraining what Foundry may do
- **Dependencies** — every addition needs a written justification, a pinned version and a hash
- **Wallet, macaroon or key handling**
- **Economic execution** — anything that moves money, with or without a human approving it
- **The public event schema and its delivery** — anything published outside the operator's
  machine, and the path it travels
- **The economic definitions** — they are the reward signal everything else optimizes

If your change touches one of these, say so in the description. It speeds review rather than
slowing it.

## Economic claims

If a PR reports an economic result, use the terms in
[`docs/economics.md`](docs/economics.md) or define new ones explicitly. State the baseline,
the period, and which costs are included.

Simulated results are demonstrations, never evidence that a strategy is profitable on a real
node.

## Decisions

Choices that are expensive to revisit — the implementation language, the license for model
weights, the shape of the public feed — belong in [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/) as a
short record: what was decided, what the alternatives were, and why. Written at the time,
while the reasoning is still in someone's head.

A decision record is not a design document. Half a page is usually right.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Privately, never in a public issue. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
